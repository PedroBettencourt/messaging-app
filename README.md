# Messasing App

Messaging app that allows users to register, log in, and send messages to any user in their contacts as well as other contacts that are in the database.

For the frotend, the app uses React, for the backend it uses Express, and for the database it uses Prisma.

To use the app without having to register, the example account is "testing", with "abcdef" as the password.

[It is deployed here using render.](https://messaging-app-qffp.onrender.com)

Below is an example of the app, where the users testing and testing2 are talking.
